# How-to-choose-the-best-Machine-Learning-algorithm-for-your-problem-statement-
Keeping healthcare problems in mind, we must hence look for models which are able to detect the disease as much as possible. In this article, let us learn how to accomplish the same. We will be working on the healthcare problem statement of predicting heart failure given the patient's details, building three relevant Machine Learning models, obtaining their confusion matrices, and comparing their performances in order to finalize the best model.
